# Certification

All members of the Department of Midwifery must be registered with the College of Midwives of British Columbia and be members of the Midwives Association of British Columbia.

In order to become Registered Midwives prior to the establishment of an educational program in BC, midwives were assessed through a very rigorous process that examined their credentials and experience and required them to demonstrate their competency through a series of examinations.

Midwives who are licensed in another jurisdiction may apply for registration in BC by applying to the PLEA (Prior Learning and Experience Assessment) program with the College of Midwives. The exception to this is midwives trained in Canadian educational programs as there is reciprocity between those provinces with educational programs in place.

There is an accredited educational program for midwives in BC at the University of British Columbia in the Faculty of Medicine, Department of Family Practice, Division of Midwifery. The program is a 4 year Baccalaureate program and all graduates of this program may apply to the College for registration.
